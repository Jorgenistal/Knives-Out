    "- No variable has been carried over from one stage to another, following the requirements. But it is true that 3 global variables have been created. According to the requirements it is recommended not to use them (so we can use them).The reason why they have been created is because in stage_1_1 three people have to be interrogated. For each interrogation I have created a function because it was more comfortable. Then the reason for the global variable is to avoid the user to interrogate the same person 2 or 3 times. So each time the user has chosen a person, it has been saved in a global variable so that it could be taken into the next function, although always being part of the same stage. In addition, at the end of the stage (stage_1_2) the user is told which persons he/she has questioned. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The first input in the def stage_1_1 (): has been put there because if you just hit print(the information inside the prompt), sometimes the question of who you want to interrogate first and then the little introduction that we are starting appears first. \n",
    "\n",
    "- In the last stage there is a possible improvement. In case the user enters a name that is not a suspect in the question who hired you, it will not count as an attempt, because there is a conditional statement that will tell you that it is not an option and will return you to the question. The problem comes in the second question. Because if you typed correctly the first name but is the wrong answer, regardless of whether the second is misspelled, as the other option is wrong, but it is spelled correctly, it will count as an error. So technically it is not a bug, but it could be improved. But it has been foreseen that in case the first option is the correct one, and you misspell the second one, it will not count as an attempt and will tell you that it is not an option. \n",
